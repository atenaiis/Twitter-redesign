# Twitter-redesign
Capstone Project of the Ruby on Rails Curriculum in Microverse.

The project consisted of creating an MVP of an app that works similar to Twitter. With the implementation of the following functionalities:

- Users log in only with username (proper authentication was not a requirement).
- Before a user logs in they can only see the Log in/Sign up page.
- When they log in they have full access to the app.
- Users can post tweets.
- Users can follow other users.
- Users can unfollow other users.
- Users can add a profile photo and a profile cover image

## N+1 Problem

In the application, each User has a collection of Followings objects. Another way to say this is:

- User ‚Üí Following is a one-to-many relationship.
And then each Following has a User who is being followed by a given User.

In other words, you have one select for the Followings, and then N additional selects, where N is the total number of other users followed.

an example of this in the application is in the `users_controller.rb`

```ruby
def show
  @user = User.includes(followers: :follower, followings: :followed).find(@user.id)
  # ...
end
```
